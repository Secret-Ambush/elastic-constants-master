A functional test of the Castep analysis script

This should be put under the python test harness, but in the
meantime:

Do: 

python ../../elastics.py jadeite_4_30_GPa

This will run the analysis script and produce jadeite_4_30GPa_cij.txt

To check the analysis worked compare this with jadeite_4_30GPa_cij.txt_REFERENCE

Note - this is from my PCM paper on jadeite and diopside
